Assignment 1:


Handwritten Digit Recognition. 
Task 1. [ 1 Point]

Download the famous MNIST digit recognition dataset from Kaggle and load and view the data in your system

Task 2. [10 points]

Compare accuracy of K-Nearest Neighbors classifier for the MNIST digit recognition dataset. 
You must figure out the best value of K for this problem by using validation data kept separate for this purpose.
Also use i) cosine similarity and ii) Euclidean distance (also known as L2-norm) for computing the nearest neighbors of an input instance 
using the raw images. 

Task 3. [10 points]

Use gradient descent to train a system of ten sigmoid units each trained to discriminate a single digit from the rest of the digits. 
Use perceptron learning rule to train a system of ten threshold units each trained to discriminate a single digit from the rest of the 
digits. 
Report the test accuracy of each of these systems.

Task 4. [10 points]

Train a feed-forward neural network having multiple layers for recognizing a digit. Unlike the previous tasks, you must use existing implementation of ANN to complete this part

Submission: Submit a comprehensive report (prepared using LATEX) briefly describing each of the method and a detailed comparison of itâ€™s 
performance with the other methods. 


Assignment 2:

Task 1.
Use SVM along with HOG features for MNIST Digit classification (Just find an implement and execute it to produce results)

Task 2.
Compare the results with Kernel Perceptron Learning
	(Implement from definition and compute results)
  
  Assignment 3: Probablistic classification of MNIST Using Naive Bayes Algorithm
